2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
152 out of 152 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: CC_n[3:0], CC_p[3:0], XCHN_n[3:0], XCHN_p[3:0], m00_axis_tdata[31:0],
m00_axis_tstrb[3:0], s00_axi_araddr[2], s00_axi_araddr[3],
s00_axi_awaddr[2], s00_axi_awaddr[3], s00_axi_bresp[1:0],
s00_axi_rdata[31:0], s00_axi_rresp[1:0], s00_axi_wdata[31:0],
s00_axi_wstrb[3:0] (the first 15 of 39 listed).
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
152 out of 152 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: CC_n[3:0], CC_p[3:0], XCHN_n[3:0], XCHN_p[3:0], m00_axis_tdata[31:0],
m00_axis_tstrb[3:0], s00_axi_araddr[2], s00_axi_araddr[3],
s00_axi_awaddr[2], s00_axi_awaddr[3], s00_axi_bresp[1:0],
s00_axi_rdata[31:0], s00_axi_rresp[1:0], s00_axi_wdata[31:0],
s00_axi_wstrb[3:0] (the first 15 of 39 listed).

REQP-1577#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
MMCME2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal clrx_inst/node1_inst/clkgn_inst/pllmmcm_px on the clrx_inst/node1_inst/clkgn_inst/MMCME2_BASE_inst/CLKFBOUT pin of clrx_inst/node1_inst/clkgn_inst/MMCME2_BASE_inst does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned and therefore zero hold time at the IO flip-flop(s) may not be met.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1580#1 Warning
Phase alignment  
Unsupported clocking topology used for ISERDESE2 clrx_inst/node1_inst/clkgn_inst/iserdes_mm. This can result in corrupted data. The clrx_inst/node1_inst/clkgn_inst/iserdes_mm/CLK / clrx_inst/node1_inst/clkgn_inst/iserdes_mm/CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type or by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase relationship. Please refer to the Select I/O User Guide for supported clocking topologies of the chosen INTERFACE_TYPE mode.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1580#2 Warning
